# Changelog

## v1.3.0 (2026-06-10)

### Features

- **Idempotency** — `defineAction({ idempotency })` and `createActionClient().idempotency()` replay a stored result for duplicate `Idempotency-Key` requests (Stripe-style semantics): same key + same payload replays without re-running the handler, a different payload returns `422 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSE`, concurrent duplicates await the in-flight execution, and failures stay retryable. Keys are scopable per identity via `scope` (recommended: session user id, since replay skips middleware), storage is pluggable via `IdempotencyStore` (bounded in-memory default; `createMemoryIdempotencyStore` exported), and store outages degrade gracefully (best-effort persistence, binary inputs fingerprinted by digest).
- **Global action hooks** — `action:start`, `action:success`, `action:error`, and `action:settled` fire on `nuxtApp` for every `useAction`/`useOptimisticAction` call (and the composables built on them), with typed payloads including `durationMs`. Fire-and-forget: a slow or throwing hook never affects the action.
- **Retry backoff** — `retry: { backoff: 'exponential' | 'linear', maxDelay, jitter }` grows delays per attempt, caps them, and randomizes within [50%, 100%] to avoid thundering-herd retries. The default stays flat.
- **`cancelPrevious` + `cancel()`** — `cancelPrevious: true` on `useAction`/`useFormAction` is shorthand for `dedupe: 'cancel'` (type-ahead search), and the new `cancel()` method — available on `useAction`, `useOptimisticAction`, and `useFormAction` — aborts the in-flight request without clearing state (unlike `reset()`). `useOptimisticAction` always cancels the previous request. Abort detection now keys off the owned AbortController signal, and the `timeout` option is enforced client-side (`TIMEOUT_ERROR`, 408) since ofetch ignores its timeout when an external signal is set.
- **Typed error codes** — `ActionError.code` is now the open union `ActionErrorCode` (all built-in codes with autocomplete, custom codes still assignable), and `isActionError` is auto-imported client-side for narrowing unknown errors.
- **Grouped `actions` namespace** — `#actions` additionally exports one `actions` object mirroring the directory structure: `actions.auth.login` is the same typed reference as the flat `authLogin`. Collisions warn at build time and fall back to flat exports.

### Hardening (production-readiness audit)

- **SSR polling leak fixed** — `useActionQuery({ refetchInterval })` no longer starts its interval on the server, where the effect scope is never disposed (it leaked one timer per request and re-invoked the action forever).
- **No hydration mismatch in infinite queries** — `useInfiniteActionQuery` now derives the first page from `useAsyncData` at render time instead of via an immediate watcher Vue stops during SSR, so the first page renders in the server HTML. `hasNextPage`/`nextPageParam` are now reactively derived.
- **Stale responses never clobber newer state** — overlapping `useAction` calls (default concurrent) only let the latest call write `data`/`error`/`status`; `cancel()`/`reset()` now abort every in-flight request, not just the most recent.
- **Timeout settles immediately** — the `timeout` deadline now races the request, so it settles at the deadline instead of waiting out an in-progress retry-backoff sleep; the abort also stops ofetch's retry loop.
- **`cancel()` never throws** — cancelling a debounced/throttled call now settles pending callers with an `ABORT_ERROR` result instead of rejecting, keeping the documented "never throws" contract.
- **Idempotency races closed** — the in-flight claim is registered before the async store read (no double-run with shared/async stores), store keys are composed injectively (a client key can't collide across `scope`s), and fingerprints are stored as a constant-size SHA-256 digest.
- **Rate limiter is flood-resistant** — the per-request full-store prune is amortized to once per window (O(1) amortized) and the store is size-capped, removing an unauthenticated CPU/memory-exhaustion vector under spoofed-key floods.
- **Streaming detects disconnect** — `defineStreamAction` handlers receive `stream.signal`, which aborts when the client disconnects, so long-running handlers can stop instead of running to completion for a gone client.
- **Smart-cache lookup is O(matching keys)** — the tag registry is indexed tag → keys, so a mutation resolves affected queries without scanning every registered key.
- **OpenAPI document is built once** and cached per process; colocated action HMR no longer force-restarts the dev server every change.

## v1.2.0 (2026-06-10)

### Bug Fixes

- Generated `#actions` module no longer imports `nuxt-actions/dist/runtime/types` (an unexported subpath that broke consumer typechecking under modern module resolution); `TypedActionReference` is now inlined into the generated file, making it self-contained.
- `invalidateActions()` now resolves matching query keys and passes them to `refreshNuxtData` as an array — the previous predicate form was a no-op because `refreshNuxtData` only accepts `string | string[]`.
- Internal types now import `Ref`/`ComputedRef` from `vue` instead of relying on the ambient `globalThis.Ref`, so the package typechecks standalone.
- `useActionQuery`/`useInfiniteActionQuery` omit the `watch` option when no input is given instead of passing the invalid `watch: false`.
- Various internal type-soundness fixes across `defineAction`, `useAction`, `useActions`, `useActionState`, `useStreamActionQuery`, and the DevTools tab registration.

### Features

- **Smart cache invalidation** — `useActionMutation` auto-refetches affected queries after a successful mutation, targeting typed action references and/or string tags. Adds `invalidateTags()`, array support in `invalidateActions()`, and a `tags` option on `useActionQuery`.
- **CLI scaffolding** — `npx nuxt-actions add <name>` generates a typed action file (`--method`, `--dir`, `--schema`).
- **DevTools** — the actions tab lists each endpoint with a ready-to-copy curl snippet and an "Open docs" link.
- **OpenAPI** — generate an OpenAPI 3.1 document (and optional Swagger UI) from your actions via the `openapi` module option. Precise bodies for arktype and Zod 4; graceful fallback otherwise.
- **File uploads** — `multipart/form-data` requests are parsed into typed `ActionFile` fields.
- **Auth preset** — `defineAuthMiddleware` resolves the current user into `ctx.user` or rejects with 401.
- `useOptimisticAction` accepts a distinct `TData` for `currentData`/`updateFn`/`optimisticData`, so the optimistic source can be a collection different from the action output (e.g. optimistically updating a list).
- `ActionMiddleware` may return `void` (for the chain-skip pattern where a middleware does not call `next()`).

## v1.0.3 (2026-02-21)

### Fixes

- Fix unhandled promise rejection in debounce/throttle when the wrapped function throws
